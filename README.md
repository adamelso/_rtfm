RTFM
====

A PHP library for creating and reading RTF documents. RTFM stands for Rich Text Format Manager (what else could it
possibly stand for?).

This is still work in progress. If you'll like to contribute, be sure to check out the officical RTF specification from
Microsoft (version 1.9.1). http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=10725
